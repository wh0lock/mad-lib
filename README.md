# mad-lib
A simple Python program that allows the user to fill in a mad-lib. Mad-lib is based on "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie" by Laura Joffe Numeroff. 
```
If you give a mouse a cookie, he’s going to ask for a glass of milk. 
When you give him the milk, he’ll probably ask you for a straw. 
When he’s finished, he’ll ask for a napkin. 
Then he’ll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn’t have a milk moustache. 
When he looks into the mirror, he might notice his hair needs a trim, 
so he’ll probably ask for a pair of nail scissors.  
When he’s finished giving himself a trim, he’ll want a broom to sweep up. He’ll start sweeping. 
He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house. 
 
If you give a {animal} a {food}, he’s going to ask for a {drink}. 
When you give him the {drink}, he’ll probably ask you for a {utensil}.  
When’s he’s finished, he’ll ask for a {item}. 
Then he’ll want to {verb} in a {place} to make sure he doesn’t {activity}.  
When he {verb} into the {place}, he might notice {characteristic}, 
so he’ll probably ask for a {tool}.  
When he’s finished {adverb}, he’ll want a {tool2}. He’ll start {adverb2}. 
He might get carried away and {verb2} every {item2} in the {place2}.
